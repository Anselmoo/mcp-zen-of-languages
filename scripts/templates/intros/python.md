Python's zen principles come directly from [PEP 20 — The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/). If you've ever typed `import this` in a Python REPL, you've seen them. MCP Zen of Languages turns these aphorisms into **actionable code analysis** — 12 principles enforced by 23 detectors.

!!! tip "Deepest analysis available"
    Python is the only language with full **AST parsing**, **cyclomatic complexity** measurement, **maintainability index** scoring, and **dependency graph analysis**. Other languages use regex-based detection.

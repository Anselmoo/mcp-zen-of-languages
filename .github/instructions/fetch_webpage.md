# External research usage guidance

Use web-sourced content only as supporting context, never as the primary source of truth for this repository.

When applying external guidance:
- Prefer existing project patterns in `src/mcp_zen_of_languages/` first.
- Verify all commands and paths against `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Keep changes minimal, test-backed, and aligned with Python 3.12 + Pydantic v2 conventions.

Do not copy long external prose into repository docs or instruction files unless explicitly requested.
